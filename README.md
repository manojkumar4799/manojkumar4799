Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Manoj Kumar Mutukuloju


I'm a game programmer with computer science and engineering background. My passion for games can be traced back from good old childhood day playing contra, as a teenager playing assassin's creed and as an adult developing games which is always high and constant. Interest keeps me up at nights, a hunger to develop games. Started building games when I was in engineering 4th year and submitted two games as my college projects for which I received "Achiever of the week" award as appreciation.


  After my graduation, I have been doing apprenticeship at Outscal, Delhi. In Outscal I have learned how to write optimized codes for games. Implemented MVC, Generic Singleton, State, observer and Object pool design patterns. I have strong Understnading of OOPs and Data Structure and Algorithms.
